## Introduction

The GameHub is a comprehensive gaming platform currently incorporating three classic games: Memory Tile (PokeTiles) Game, BlackJack (21 Game) and Tic Tac Toe. Each game has been implemented using a multitude of essential OOP principles with an emphasis on front-end to offer user-friendly interfaces for seamless gameplay and interactive visuals. Furthering the scope of our project, we intend to include more games in the later phases.

The implementation of user logins and databases in the project allows for personalised gaming experiences and facilitates the dynamic tracking of users' win rates across the games, enhancing user engagement and fostering a competitive gaming environment.

## Prerequisites

To run the application open the folder in your project workspace and change the pathnames of the following files and images:

`MainMenu.java` :
	miniprojfront.png
	blackjack.png
	poketiles.png
	tictactoe.png

`Login.java`:
	users.csv
	miniprojfront.png
	login.png
	signup.png

`TicTacToe.java`:
	orangex.png
	logo.png
	score.txt

`Main.java`(Memory Game):
	users.csv

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `images`: the folder which contains all the images

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default
